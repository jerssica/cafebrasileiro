    From our home in Rio de Janeiro and our business base in New York City, our beverage company - Buy Brasil - will continue to expand its selection of products, services and its market penetration over the coming years. Buy Brasil is a producer of quality Brazilian beverages and we intend to market these beverages into the global marketplace. Our intention is to also bring our customers closer to the origin of our ideas and encourage buyers to get to know the product brand and the people who manage the brand. We believe there is far too much base commodity out there and not near enough of a personal connection to the niche origins of the product. The Buy Brasil client focus is hotels, restaurants, cocktail bars, holiday resorts and cafes. This is the preferred clientele that better suits our business profile. Our marketing will continue to reflect more about the niche qualities of Brazilian coffee and cachaça and the positive value of direct communication with its Brazilian producers. When it comes to Brazilian commodity and lifestyle products there’s a point worth noting. International consumers are intrigued, they don’t have to buy Brazilian products, they want to buy Brazilian products.
